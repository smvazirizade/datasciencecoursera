The man script, run_analysis.R. includes 5 steps:  
 Step1 Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set  
 Step2 Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement  
 Step3 Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
 Step4 Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names  
 Step5 From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
